# Sujatha R – Search & AI Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my developer-focused documentation portfolio built with Docusaurus and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I am a Senior Technical Writer specializing in:

- Search systems and indexing
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- API documentation for RESTful services
- Documentation architecture and developer experience

I design documentation that bridges core engine engineering and real-world developer implementation.

## 📚 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

This site is structured like a production documentation system and showcases:

- Conceptual guides (Search fundamentals, Vector search, RAG)
- API documentation samples (request/response schema, cURL examples)
- Architecture deep dives (Indexing, mapping, scoring)
- Tutorials combining search + AI workflows

The goal is to reflect a "docs-as-product" mindset.
